**Scenario:**
Suppose we are building a real-time analytics platform for an e-commerce website. We want to track user activity, process orders, and analyze product sales data. We'll have multiple producers generating data related to user activity, order processing, and product sales, and multiple consumers processing this data for different purposes.

**Components:**

1. User Activity Producer: Produces data about user activities such as page views, searches, and clicks.
2. Order Producer: Produces data about orders placed by users.
3. Sales Producer: Produces data about product sales.
4. Analytics Consumer: Consumes user activity data to generate analytics like user engagement metrics.
5. Order Processing Consumer: Consumes order data to process orders and update inventory.
6. Sales Analytics Consumer: Consumes sales data to generate sales analytics.


**Application Structure:**

Let's create separate modules for producers and consumers:

**Producers Module:**
1. User Activity Producer
2. Order Producer
3. Sales Producer

**Consumers Module:**
1. Analytics Consumer
2. Order Processing Consumer
3. Sales Analytics Consumer
